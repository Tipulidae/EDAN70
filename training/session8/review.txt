The network first plays about a minute of haydn, then changes to beethoven for the remaining 9 minutes or so, with a few single notes from other composers (guest artists!).
 
In general not a huge difference between the composer-agnostic network. Perhaps a bit more consistently melancholic, with several long, slow sequences with strange sounding chords, interspersed with sequences of fast and aggressive playing. A bit less erratic in general, fewer strange 

The haydn part in the beginning is a bit different from the rest, but it's not enough to say for sure whether it's just a coincidence or not. 

01:30-01:55 is relatively "good"...
02:50 long sequence of slow chords...
07:02 interesting chord progression
